Today is the last day of the August , also the last day of my first week in senior life.

Before, I don't know what I need to do , what I want to be, so I could play lots of games and do nothing everyday.

Now, I know what I want and also know what I have to face that make me so frustrated . Everyday having so many works to do , so many plans to finish , so many unwilling smiles and hands to give, I begin to change to a guy that I totally don't want to be!

Sometimes I envy that children can cry, girls can cry , women can cry , but man. I have so much pressure but I can't cry to drop them off.

Sometimes I will cry unbridledly in dreams , I cry so heavy in my dreams even wake me up and find tears soaked my pillow.

I don't know why I'm so sad in dream and even scared. But my body tell me that I am tired.

Few days ago see a girl write a poem called 《write in a lonely day》 that really warmed me up.
After reading it , I want to say so much that not only you, a girl ,but also me , a man ,need someone too. The one who can see my weakness clearly and give me a hand when I need ; the one who can cheer me up and give me a encouraging story when I am down .
But I know I am a man, a man should solve all the things by himself. So I don't even extravagant hope someone can listen my nagging. I won't tell either.
 What I can do is give others a smile and give others a hand if they need with my sorrows burried deep in my heart.

I know my english is poor , but I can't write these kind of charactor in my mother language.

Linux is free , but I am not ...
