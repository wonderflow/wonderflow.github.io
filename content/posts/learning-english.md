Recently, I feel my life is full of English . Reading English materials , asking technical problems with English emails , and sometimes joking with friends. Reading is OK but it's really headache for me to write , speak and listen . It's really a  little pity not spending more time on it before. But things always like this , only your turn to use will you understand how it's enviable to speak  fluent English . Even one day I told a friend , I fell in love with someone who speak very good English . Then I told that's true unless I could have the same skill.

Last week, I watched the film "American Dreams In China" . It's really moving and I know that's what I  want. How I want to fight with brothers to do what we love to do , to have a space only belong to us and to earn my own living ! A year ago I lost the chance and chose a different way to go, I'm sure to catch it two years later .My brothers , wait for me to go back ! I promise to find all of you bringing a brand new bobo.

Life here is ordinary . I'm happy with my work learning but a little lonely with very few friends here. Sometimes when I miss roomies before very much , I will give them a call talking each other's life. In fact they are near  surrounded  with QQs telephones and messages if you want to keep contacts.

At last still that motto for myself :  Never give up , and nothing replaces hard work.
