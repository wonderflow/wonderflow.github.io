      <p>Today is the last day of the August , also the last day of my first week in senior life.</p>
<p>Before, I don&rsquo;t know what I need to do , what I want to be, so I could play lots of games and do nothing everyday.</p>
<p>Now, I know what I want and also know what I have to face that make me so frustrated . Everyday having so many works to do , so many plans to finish , so many unwilling smiles and hands to give, I begin to change to a guy that I totally don&rsquo;t want to be!</p>
<p>Sometimes I envy that children can cry, girls can cry , women can cry , but man. I have so much pressure but I can&rsquo;t cry to drop them off.</p>
<p>Sometimes I will cry unbridledly in dreams , I cry so heavy in my dreams even wake me up and find tears soaked my pillow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m so sad in dream and even scared. But my body tell me that I am tired.</p>
<p>Few days ago see a girl write a poem called 《write in a lonely day》 that really warmed me up.
After reading it , I want to say so much that not only you, a girl ,but also me , a man ,need someone too. The one who can see my weakness clearly and give me a hand when I need ; the one who can cheer me up and give me a encouraging story when I am down .
But I know I am a man, a man should solve all the things by himself. So I don&rsquo;t even extravagant hope someone can listen my nagging. I won&rsquo;t tell either.
What I can do is give others a smile and give others a hand if they need with my sorrows burried deep in my heart.</p>
<p>I know my english is poor , but I can&rsquo;t write these kind of charactor in my mother language.</p>
