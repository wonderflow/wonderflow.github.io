So today I list some of them here ： 《Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach》written by James F.

then maybe i need to introduce myself in English. So? let&rsquo;s begin:
Hello, my name is Sunjianbo. i come from wuxi jiangsu province。That‘s really beautiful place and not far from hangzhou。I major in network engineering in the computer science college of nanjing university of science and technology！
Before I come in to the university I love computer very much，especially computer games you know。But after my first year of senior school， I become interested in computer algorithm 。 So I joined our school ACM/ICPC training team. I worked hard there and dived into the interesting algorithms. Another year later, i become the team leader of the ACM/ICPC training team.
I have also participate in the 2011 ACM/ICPC Asia Shanghai regional contest ， and finally got a bronze medal。And several days later I&rsquo;ll participate the 2012 ACM/ICPC Asia changchun regional contest。
As I have spent almost three years of my college life in ACM team ， I am stronger at C&#43;&#43; programing 、 data structure and common algorithms.">

and so on..
this really remind me to respect the author of a famous book, as they are so great to give the word such great books!</p>
<p>then maybe i need to introduce myself in English. So? let&rsquo;s begin:</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Sunjianbo. i come from wuxi jiangsu province。That‘s really beautiful place and not far from hangzhou。I major in network engineering in the computer science college of nanjing university of science and technology！</p>
<p>Before I come in to the university I love computer very much，especially computer games you know。But after my first year of senior school， I become interested in computer algorithm 。 So I joined our school ACM/ICPC training team. I worked hard there and dived into the interesting algorithms. Another year later, i become the team leader of the ACM/ICPC training team.</p>
<p>I have also participate in the 2011 ACM/ICPC Asia Shanghai regional contest ， and finally got a bronze medal。And several days later I&rsquo;ll participate the 2012 ACM/ICPC Asia changchun regional contest。</p>
<p>As I have spent almost three years of my college life in ACM team ， I am stronger at C++ programing 、 data structure and common algorithms. In projects ， I have made a platform for our college AI programing contest in 2011。 That was really a big project that I led about tens people to work more than a month to build it up。</p>
<p>The computer science in Zhejiang university is top ten in our country so I hope I could come here to get my master degree。</p>
<p>Thougth I worked hard in my senior school， i know I still have a lot of weaknesses。 I’m willing to continuely learn  hard in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all of my self introduction, thank you!</p>
